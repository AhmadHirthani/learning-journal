## HTML
We have a lot of documents type in our life and each type has its own syntax, HTML is a type of document with a special syntax.
HTML is a language that describes the content of web pages. HTML syntax based on tags and a group of elements inside these tags. Each element should have two tags, open tag and close tag.  For example to add a paragraph we use the tag <p> our paragraph </p>.

We start the HTML document with tag **DOCTYPE** to tell the browser, which is translate the HTML to a view, tell the browser that this is an HTML document also we can advertise the version of html 4 or 5.
All developers need to write their own notes besides their code. So we can write **comments** using between the <!-- your note --> markers.

During our working with HTML we may face more than one element with the same tag. What if we want to deal with a specific element? Thanks for **attributes** we can add **id** attribute inside the opening tag and write a uniqe id for this tag.

### Why HTML 5?
We mentioned that we have two versions of HTML. HTML 5 comes to be easier since we declare the elements with their real names instead of using the IDs to name the divs tags. But unfortunately HTML 5 is not supported from all browsers.

### How to start?
Before start coding, you need to answer 5 questions. If you do, you will have a good webpage with a lot of visitors. The answers for these question must be clear to help in putting thing in the right place and organize your webpage in professional manner.
