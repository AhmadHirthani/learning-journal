## How Computer Works
### What makes acmoputer, a computer
Each computer, smartphone or robot use these four component (Input, Store, Process, Output).
For input they used devices such as keyboard, mouse, touch screen, sensors, camera or mice. Memory used for storing what we have inputed and CPU which is the master chip in computer is responsible for calculations and operations. Screen, printer and speackers are output devices.

### Binary and Data
Computer transmit data between its component and with other computers using electrical signs. But how electrical signs can represent naumbers, text, images and videos?
Actually these electrical signs are either 5 volts (on) or 0 Volts (off). This means we need a maner to represent our data as on/off. Thanks to ### Binary system we can represent everytrhing with Zero's and One's and these Zero's and One's are translated into on/off electrical signs. In Decimal system, the number 1951 is (1x**1**)+(5x**10**)+(9x**100**)+(1x**1000**)=1951. But in binary system, the number 1010 is (0x**1**)+(1x**2**)+(0x**4**)+(1x**8**)=10. The main idea og binary system is transform the normal numbers into binary system. For text we assign a number for each charachter then it is easy to convert number to binary. For images each image consist of pixels which a set of numbers for each color of basic colors.

### Hardware and Software
We can see the physical component of computer such as stuff, circuits, chips, wires, speackers and plugs. But we can not see the Computer software which is the programs or code that run on hardware.

### Operation System OS
Operation system is a mastering program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
How can computer run alot of operation at the same time?
Actually CPU can run only one instruction at one unit of time. OS have the job to switch between more than one operation quickly and thanks to high speed of CPUs we can run many application in our devices at the time without noticing the swiching process.
