## Version Control
Version Control allows us to track the changes we make to the code so that we can return to a specific version of the changes if needed.

### Local Version Control
Local version control works on your device side since you can prepare everything in your side then push updates to cloud.

### Centralized Version Control CVCS
Centralized Version Control stores our code in the cloud then whenever we need to access our code from anywhere we can do. Also we can share our code easily depends on Centralized Version Control. Centralized Version Control store data in one place and whoever want to access this server can do from anywhere if has the privilege to do.

### Distributed Version Control DVCS
 Centralized Version Control face a problem called "single point of failure" which is when the sever fail, all of users who depend on this server will lose the service. DVCS becomes to overcome problems of CVS by allowing clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
 Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.
 
 ### what is Git?
 Git is the prtocol that used to implement the DVCS. Since it saves a Snapshots every time we order a commit which is saving changes.
