## Markdown

Markdown is A simple way to format text or code that is written in the GitHub files. Formatting includes
Headings, Styling text, Quoting text, Quoting code, Links, Section links, Relative links, Lists, Task lists, Mentioning people and teams, Referencing issues and pull requests, Referencing external resources, Content attachments, Using emoji and Paragraphs.

### Headers:
Lets start with the most important format in the Markdown which is Headings. For Headings we have six headers start from 1 to 6, # Header 1 is the biggest and ###### Header 6 is the smallest one. To use headers we use the hash tags in the start of the line we want to format. The count of hash tags used represent the header number.


#### Headers Example:
For the pre line we use four hash tags before the world #### Headers Example  because we want to use the header number four.

### EMOJIs:
Thanks to Markdown, we can also write Emojis by typing EMOJICODE between two colons

#### EMOJI Example:
:+1: The code +1 generate the like thumb.
:shipit: The code shipit
