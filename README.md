## Growth mindset

The growth mindset believes that one's basic capabilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

In contrast, intelligence and talent in a fixed mindset are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent traits alone, without the need for further development or effort.
