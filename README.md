## Welcome to Ahmad Alhirthani Learning-Journal Page
You can find more about Markdown language at the [Learning-Journal Page](https://ahmadhirthani.github.io/learning-journal/).

### Intro
On this page I am trying to talk about some of the things that need to be simplified. Read about it and write in a way that the average reader can understand. The goal is to simplify things to become more understanding and thus contribute more to the spread of science.
